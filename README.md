# Know Your Bundle

Get basic dependency informations about your webpack bundle; This project works similarly to http://webpack.github.io/analyse/, all information is processed locally in the browser, nothing is saved remotely (you will be GETting npm registry and GitHub API however)


## Roadmap
- Improve looks
- List dependency reasons
- Implement filters/sorting
- Delay GitHub API requests to avoid rate limits
- Add reducer caching w/ localStorage
- Improve API error feedback (and add a reload button in each module that hasn&abpos;t loaded)
